# TIMIDY - Statistical NLP Final Project
A chat system where the responses are generated based on the input text

#### Team: Ismayil Hasanov, Swati Raghuwanshi, Han Wang
#### Instructor: Yassine Benajiba
### Introduction
In this project we applied and experimented with the current state-of-art NLP techniques to try and solve this problem. We used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically sequence to sequence (seq2seq) deep learning methodology. 
### Dataset
Chat corpus repo (https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/chat_corpus)
### Methods
* Preprocessing the data
* Building the models
* Testing the models
### Files
* Word-based: word_seq2seq.py
* Character-based: Character_seq2seq.py
* Word-based with embedding: word_embedding_seq2seq.py
